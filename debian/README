If you want to create or edit gtk themes using murrine engine, you can use
following options:

Murrine Style Options:
- glazestyle (change general look, i.e. buttons)
    * 0 = flat hilight
    * 1 = curved hilight
    * 2 = concave style
    * 3 = top curved hilight
    * 4 = beryl/emerald style
- roundness (set roundness of buttons and other widgets)
    * 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 = From flat till too rounded =).
    Few notes more:
    1.    concave style (glazestyle = 2) is supported just with roundness = 0,1.
    2.    clearlooks-like default (nice) roundess is "3".
- menubarstyle (change style of the menubar)
    * 0 = flat
    * 1 = glassy (it follows selected glazestyle)
    * 2 = gradient
    * 3 = striped
- menuitemstyle (change look of menuitems)
    * 0 = flat
    * 1 = glassy (it follows selected glazestyle)
    * 2 = striped
- menubaritemstyle (change look of menubar items)
    * 0 = menuitem look
    * 1 = button look

    * 0 = flat
    * 1 = glassy (it follows selected glazestyle)
    * 2 = raised

    * 0 = nothing (completely flat)
    * 1 = dotted separators

    * set it to less for a concave theme
- contrast (set the contrast of the theme)
     * e.g. contrast = 0.8 for less contrast or more than 1.0 for more contrast on borders!
